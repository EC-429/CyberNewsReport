The CyberNews NewsReport is a command line tool that can be used to quickly display the latest stories from three of the major cyber news outlets: Bleeping Computer, Krebs on Security, and Vice Motherboard.<br><br>

This project is coded in python3 and requires the following packages:<br>

`git clone https://github.com/rpanov/CyberNewsReport.git`<br>
`$python3 NewsReport.py -h`<br>
